## Web Scraping Perfume Information

### Overview:
This project involved creating a Python script using BeautifulSoup to scrape perfume data from a website. The challenge included handling 403 errors, extracting relevant information such as perfume names and top notes, and manipulating the dataset for further analysis.

### Project Steps:
1. **Handling 403 Errors:** Implemented error handling to manage HTTP 403 Forbidden errors encountered during web scraping.
   
2. **Data Extraction:** Utilized BeautifulSoup to extract key information from the perfume website, including perfume names and their corresponding top notes.
   
3. **Dataset Manipulation:** Processed the extracted data to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis. This included organizing the data into appropriate data structures and cleaning it for consistency.

### Results:
The script successfully navigated through the challenges of web scraping, gathering valuable information on perfume products. The resulting dataset provides a comprehensive overview of perfume names and their associated top notes, enabling further analysis of consumer preferences and market trends.

### Future Enhancements:
Future improvements to the project could include implementing advanced error handling mechanisms for a smoother web scraping experience, expanding data extraction to include additional perfume attributes, and incorporating visualization techniques to present insights derived from the dataset.
